# Scaling-and-Normalization
#### Scaling and Normalization aids in the transformation of numeric variables for accurate modelling.

### Have you ever struggled with a machine learning model that just wouldn't converge, no matter how much you tweaked the hyper parameters? Have you wondered how to reduce the impact of outliers which can have a disproportionate effect on the model prediction?
#### If we don't scale and normalize data, several problems can arise during the machine learning process, which can ultimately result in inaccurate or ineffective models.
